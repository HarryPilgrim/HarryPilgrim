# 👋 Hi, I'm Harold Crittenden!

With a background in physics from Durham University and international experience working in education, I’ve developed strong analytical, problem-solving, and leadership skills. After years of teaching and mentoring—guiding students in English, mathematics, and university applications—I transitioned into software development through dedicated self-study and hands-on projects.



-  I’m currently learning React and Deep Learning.
- Currently working on my poetry and language learning projects, and simulating Animal Evolution with Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms.

 # [Evolution sim](https://youtu.be/3XydFCMCIcw ) – This is a Python-based simulation of a simple ecosystem where **prey** and **predators** evolve over time based on their success in survival and reproduction. Traits like speed, energy efficiency, and vision are encoded in each agent's genes and mutate over generations.
