# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Harold Crittenden!

With a background in physics from Durham University and international experience working in education, Iâ€™ve developed strong analytical, problem-solving, and leadership skills. After years of teaching and mentoringâ€”guiding students in English, mathematics, and university applicationsâ€”I transitioned into software development through dedicated self-study and hands-on projects.

- Currently working on my poetry and language learning projects, and simulating Animal Evolution with Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms.
