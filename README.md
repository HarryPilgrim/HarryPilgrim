# 👋 Hi, I'm Harold Crittenden!

With a background in physics from Durham University and international experience working in education, I’ve developed strong analytical, problem-solving, and leadership skills. After years of teaching and mentoring—guiding students in English, mathematics, and university applications—I transitioned into software development through dedicated self-study and hands-on projects.



-  I’m currently learning React and Deep Learning.
- Currently working on my poetry and language learning projects, and simulating Animal Evolution with Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms.

# Poetry Platform: [poetryplatform.org](https://poetryplatform.org) - "the Goodreads of Poetry"

![front](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9076665b-1336-49ee-b1e2-6a267e4c3d3f)

Designed and developed a full-stack Python/Flask web application with responsive AJAX-driven frontend and a SQL database backend for managing thousands of users, poets, and poems. Scraped, processed, and managed a large JSON dataset of poems.

Currently at 200+ Users.

● Automated Poem of the Day feature that generates and posts images to multiple social media platforms using APIs (Twitter, Bluesky).

● Implemented a secure user system with account creation, authentication, password recovery via email, and role-based permissions.

● Includes advanced search functionality for poets and users, and a comments and favourites system.

● Languages/Frameworks: Python, Flask, JavaScript (AJAX), SQL

● Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, CKEditor

● Backend: Flask, SQLAlchemy, SQLite

● APIs: Social media APIs (Twitter, Bluesky), Flask-Mail

● Tools: PythonAnywhere, Playwright, JSON, Git

● Other: Data scraping, AJAX, secure password handling


- Save your favorite poets & poems
- Write & share your own poetry 
- Follow other users & engage with the community
- Post images & create a visual poetry experience

- Trained a custom DistilGPT2 model using PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers on a corpus of poetry. Fine-tuned the model locally, then pushed it to the Hugging Face Model Hub for inference. Integrated the hosted model into a Flask-based poetry website (poetryplatform.org) via Hugging Face’s Inference API, enabling users to generate AI-composed poems from text prompts directly on the site.

 # [Evolution sim](https://youtu.be/3XydFCMCIcw ) – This is a Python-based simulation of a simple ecosystem where **prey** and **predators** evolve over time based on their success in survival and reproduction. Traits like speed, energy efficiency, and vision are encoded in each agent's genes and mutate over generations.
